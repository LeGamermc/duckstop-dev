<h1>About:</h1>
<p>Duckstop is what i'd call a remote desktop protocol of its own written in python that has a very functional web client at the moment, This project was originally going to be a simple little project but i have expanded on it and with the help of LeGamermc i was able to get most of the inputs working, </p>
